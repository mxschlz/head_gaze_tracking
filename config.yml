Calibration:
  # Method to use for calibration.
  # "clustering": (RECOMMENDED FOR INFANTS) A two-pass method that analyzes a period of the video
  #               to find the most common head pose and sets it as the baseline. Most robust.
  # "gaze_informed": A single-pass method that collects samples only when the user's eyes
  #                  are looking straight ahead. Good for cooperative users.
  # "manual": No automatic calibration. You must press 'c' to set the baseline.
  # "none": No calibration is performed. Raw angle values are used.
  METHOD: "clustering"

  # Duration in seconds at the start of the video to use for automatic calibration.
  CLUSTERING_CALIB_DURATION_SECONDS: 30

  # --- Settings for "clustering" method ---

    # Set this to just before you expect the first stimulus to appear.

    # Duration (in seconds) at the start of the video to search for the active region.

    # How many rows and columns to divide the screen into for analysis.
    # More divisions are more precise but use more memory. [columns, rows]
    GRID_DIVISIONS: [30, 25]
    # (NEW) Threshold for a grid cell to be considered "active".
    # This is a percentage of the most active cell's variance.
    # Lower values (e.g., 25) create a larger, more inclusive ROI.
    # Higher values (e.g., 50) create a tighter, more focused ROI.
    ACTIVITY_THRESHOLD_PERCENT: 50
    # (Optional) You can provide a search area [x, y, w, h] to constrain the search
    # and prevent finding spurious activity in irrelevant parts of the screen.
    # If commented out, the whole screen is used.

      # This is generally more robust than using fixed pixel padding.
      PADDING_PERCENTAGE: 0

  # (Used if STIMULUS_ROI_METHOD is "static")
  # Defines the Region of Interest [x, y, width, height] on the video frame to monitor for a stimulus.

  # --- Trial Onset Detection Method ---
  # Method for detecting the start of a trial based on ROI brightness.
  # "statistical": (NEW & RECOMMENDED) Detects a trial if the brightness is a certain
  #                number of standard deviations above the baseline mean. Most robust.
  # "factor":      Detects a trial if brightness > (baseline_mean * factor). Good for high contrast.
  # "absolute":    Detects a trial if brightness > absolute_value. Least robust.

  # --- Gaze Classification (During Stimulus Period) ---
  # Method to determine if the user is looking at the stimulus.
  # "compensatory_gaze": (ADVANCED) Checks if eyes compensate for head turns.
  #                      Use this to capture looks where the head is turned but
  #                      eyes remain on the stimulus.
  # "eye_gaze_with_head_filter": (RECOMMENDED) Uses iris position but filters out frames
  #                                where the head is turned too far away.
  # "eye_gaze_only": Uses only the relative position of the iris in the eye socket.
  # "head_pose_only": Legacy method. Uses only the calibrated head pose angles.
